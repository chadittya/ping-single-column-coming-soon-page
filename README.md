## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Submit their email address using an `input` field
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - The `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say _"Whoops! It looks like you forgot to add your email"_
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say _"Please provide a valid email address"_

### What I learned

During the process of building this project, I learned several things that improved my skills as a developer. Here are some of the most important things I learned:

1. Form handling and validation: The project involved creating a form for users to submit their email addresses. I learned how to handle form submissions using React and how to validate the input to ensure it's in the correct format and not empty.
2. TypeScript: I learned how to use TypeScript to write safer and more maintainable code. By adding static typing and other features to JavaScript, I was able to catch errors earlier in the development process and write more robust code.

Overall, I learned a lot from this project and had a great time building it. I look forward to using these new skills in future projects!
